__Songs of Metal, Stone and Wood__

- main file is 'songs003.py'
- some functions are included in 'functions.py'
- haiku generation function in 'haiku.py'
- the current submission has been developed and tested using Neoscore 1.01 running under Python 3.10
- This is a demo and I haven't taken the time to fully clean up the code or structure as yet
- As it stands it will not be possible for the percussionist to play the generated part, which are there primarily for demonstration purposes

__Running the score__
- cd to the score directory
- run "python3 songs003.py"

__Flags__
- '-a' includes a variety of descriptive and (hopefully) helpful comments in the score
- '-d' includes a dynamic cursor
- e.g. "python3 songs003.py -ad" includes both annotations and dynamic cursor
